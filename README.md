# MHEALTH_HAR_ML
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using MHEALTH Dataset
This project focuses on classifying different human physical activities (such as walking, running, cycling, and resting) using physiological and motion sensor data from the MHEALTH dataset. The analysis involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying machine learning models to recognize activities based on biosignals.
